# Intel® AI Quantization Tools for Tensorflow*

> Note:Intel® AI Quantization Tools for Tensorflow* must depend on Intel® Optimizations for TensorFlow.


This repo contains tools to ease the data scientist's work.

* [Quantization Python Programming API](api/README.md#quantization-python-programming-api-quick-start):
  The quantization python programming API is an unified python interface of Tensorflow Quantization tools to
 improve the user experience. It provides the pip installation package to remove the TensorFlow source build
dependency. This package is under activate development to replace the old user interface.

* [Tensorflow Quantization](tensorflow_quantization/README.md#quantization-tools):
  Post-training model quantization and optimization can help reduce the size of your model
  and run inference faster, while maintaining accuracy. This old user interface will be retried in further.
